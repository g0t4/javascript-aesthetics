    Here's a sample implementation of a bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript:
</p>
<pre class="prettyPrint">
function comparator(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

function bubSrt(arr, cmp) {
    cmp = cmp || comparator;
    var temp;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        for (var j = i; j > 0; j -= 1) {
            if (cmp(arr[j], arr[j - 1]) < 0) {
                temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j - 1];
                arr[j - 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

bubSrt([4, 6, 2, 10, 1]);

    You can access this sample online, in a web based editor where you can make
    changes and save them, use this link to access the sample: <a

    Take some time, read up on what the bubble sort algorithm does, here's a
    link to the wikipedia page: <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank"
        class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort</a>
</p>

    And then use the techniques discussed in this module and see what changes
    you might make to enhance your understanding of the code and help others
    understand it too. There's no right answer, just see what you might change.
</p>

<p>
    Under what conditions might you leave the code as is?
</p>

<p>
    Then, when you are done, if you are curious, watch the following clip for
    the changes I decided to make.

<p>
    By the way, this example is based on the following implementation: <a
